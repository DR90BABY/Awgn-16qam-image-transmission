# Purpose
This is a matlab code is intended to simulate image transmission over 16-QAM over Additive White Gaussian Noise.

The simulation is carried over Experimental bit error rate (BER) for 10 values of (Eb/N0) from zero to ten 

The output is several windows of the image recieved and the output graph of the BER over the ten values of (Eb/No) as shown below

#### Transmited Image

#### Output Image 
The outputed images are recieved after transmission. The label at the top Shows the value of Eb/No over which the image was transmmited.

# Requirements
 
* The code was writen using Matlab 2020Ra software

# Usage
  To run the matlab file place the image "pappers.png" in the same directory as the matlab code and open the file in matlab.
