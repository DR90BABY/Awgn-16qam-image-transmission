# Purpose
This is a matlab code is intended to simulate image transmission over 16-QAM over Additive White Gaussian Noise.

The simulation is carried over Experimental bit error rate (BER) for 10 values of (Eb/N0) from zero to ten 

The output is several windows of the image recieved and the output graph of the BER over the ten values of (Eb/No) as shown below

#### Transmited Image
![Peppers.png](/image003.png)

#### Output Image 
The outputed images are recieved after transmission. The label at the top Shows the value of Eb/No over which the image was transmmited. Below are sample outputs. 
<img height="180" src="image005.png"/>
<img  height="180" src="image007.png"/>

#### Output Graph
<img alt="BER vs Eb/No" align="left" height="180" src="image001.png"/>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
 The code was writen using Matlab 2020Ra software

<h2>Usage</h2>
  To run the matlab file place the image "pappers.png" in the same directory as the matlab code and open the file in matlab.
